## Face Detection Graphing

CIS 365 Artificial Intelligence Project that detects faces and creates
a heat map and scatter plot of the location/times of detection.

### Heat Map

Custom implementation of a heat map.  Darkens as detections stay in the
same area.

### Scatter Plot

JZY3D scatter plot that graphs location(x, y) and time(z).
